      <h3>Bansal S. (Chemistry)</h3>
      <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
      <p>Minnie was an amazing tutor! Her teaching style is unique since
         she uses metaphors to explain hard concepts using every day examples.
         Thanks to her I was able to go from a C to an A in organic chemistry!
         I highly recommend her!! </p>

      <h3>Natalie E. (Chemistry, Math)</h3>
        <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
        <p>Minnie first taught me high school chemistry (EHS, Houston) and then math.
           She's very ethusiastic and genuinely cares about her student.
           I was able to boost my chemistry test scores from a 62 to a 91 as of November 2020!
          If you want your scores to improve a lot, she's the tutor for you </p>
